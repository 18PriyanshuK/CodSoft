# CodSoft Web Development Internship
# Overview

Welcome to the Basic Calculator Project repository! This project is part of my CodSoft Web Development Internship, where I developed a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and includes a feature to switch between dark and light modes.

# Project Description

To create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator features a display screen to show user input and results. The CSS grid system is used for button alignments, and JavaScript handles user input and performs calculations.

# Key Features

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface with buttons and a display screen.

CSS Grid System: Utilized for aligning buttons.

Dark and Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light modes for the calculator interface.
